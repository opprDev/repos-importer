If you have a GitHub organization and want to `clone` all repositories, you can use this [solution based provided](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68108153/2371987) by [@Bryan Guner](https://stackoverflow.com/users/15158587/bryan-guner) on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). The repository was developed by a community of people under the [opprDev](https://dev.oppr.io/) Team from [oppr](https://oppr.io/). This solution will be used in [BreastScreening](https://breastscreening.github.io/), [MIDA](https://mida-project.github.io/) and [MIMBCD-UI](https://mimbcd-ui.github.io/) research projects.

## Prerequisites

The following list is showing the required dependencies for this project to run locally:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or any other Git or GitHub version control tool
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.5 or newer)

Here are some tutorials and documentation, if needed, to feel more comfortable about using and playing around with this repository:

* [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
* [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
* [GitHub Quick Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Usage

Usage follow the instructions here to setup the current repository and extract the present data. To understand how the hereby repository is used for, read the following steps.

### Installation

At this point, the only way to install this repository is manual. Eventually, this will be accessible through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or any other package manager, as mentioned on the [roadmap](#Roadmap).

Nonetheless, this kind of installation is as simple as cloning this repository. Virtually all Git and GitHub version control tools are capable of doing that. Through the console, we can use the command below, but other ways are also fine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opprDev/repos-importer.git
```

Optionally, the module/directory can be installed into the designated Python interpreter by moving it into the site-packages directory at the respective Python directory.

### Demonstration

Please, feel free to try out our solution. It is a script called `main.py` at the `src/` directory. It can be used as follows:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Just keep in mind this is just a demo, so it does nothing more than downloading data to an arbitrary destination directory if the directory does not exist or does not have any content. Also, we did our best to make the demo as user-friendly as possible, so, above everything else, have fun! 😁

## Roadmap

[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819)

We need to follow the repository goal, by addressing the thereby information. Therefore, it is of chief importance to scale this solution supported by the repository. The repository solution follows the best practices, achieving the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3172) specifications.

Besides that, one of our goals involves creating a configuration file to automatically test and publish our code to pip or any other package manager. It will be most likely prepared for the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Other goals may be written here in the future.
